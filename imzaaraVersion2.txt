the next thing u have to do is to type 'git status' and that will show u that u have an undirectory txt file. u then type 'git add .', and then'git commit -m "a messsage"'.then type 'git log' and u will bw shown that a new commit has been added.then u can check whether it has anything that is not committed by typing 'git status'.then, simply push that by 'git push'.then it will bw pushed into gitHub :)
